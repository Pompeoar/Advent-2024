# Advent 2024

This repository contains solutions to the **2024 Advent code challenges**, written in **F#**. The primary goal is to use these challenges as a way to get familiar with the F# programming language and its functional programming paradigms.

## Project Structure

- Each day has its own module (e.g., `Day1.fs`, `Day2.fs`, etc.).
- The `Program.fs` serves as the entry point and calls the appropriate modules for each challenge.

## Goals

- Learn and apply F# syntax and features.
- Explore functional programming concepts like immutability, recursion, and pipelining.
- Solve fun coding challenges while gaining hands-on experience with F#.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pompeoar/Advent-2024.git
   cd Advent-2024
